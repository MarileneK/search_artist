# Search Artist Tool

## Description
Search Artist Tool is an application that helps you find your artist's favourite music.
You just need to enter the name of an artist from the list and you get his/her favourite music.

The aim was to put into practice my JavaScript knowledge.

(Exercise given during my fullstack bootcamp @La Capsule.)

```bash
npm i

Then start the project with
